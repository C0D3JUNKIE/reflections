When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with others and make open source project to be available to the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To ensure that you are working on the correct copy of the objects you are working with at a particular time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone is a copy of remote repository to your local machine - git clone http://address
    a fork is copoy of someone elses code into your own repository, so you dont mess with their work.
    after forking you would clone to get a local copy
    branches are copies of a specific commit sequence(line of development) that allows you to experiment with the code base without impacting the original  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    to determine where you are in the stream

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Sharing, merging, tracking changes would be harder.  Easier would be you dont have to learn GIT :)

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would make changes in a branch when working on rearchitecting a program or adding new functionality.
    The benefits of branching is that I have a fully functional master that continues to function while I experiment and make changes.
    Only using a single branch makes it easy to maintain.
